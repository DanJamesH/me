As part of the degree, I completed a year-long research project which I received a distinction for and is in the process of being converted into a research paper. The project focused on using satellite imagery (in Google Earth Engine) and drone data (which I assisted in to gather) to observe, map and assess the damage caused to infrastructure and surrounding areas by the April, 2021 Table Mountain Fire. Satellite imagery was used with machine learning classification to create burnt area maps and 3-D models of damaged buildings were created using structure-from-motion photogrammetry. I also reconstructed a timeline for the fire event using Twitter data."
